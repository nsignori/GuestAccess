GuestAccess

This program was desinged for a hackathon. The idea of it is to simulate a security panel which allows home owners to grant access for certain time periods. The program will automatically generate a new code for the guest and text it to them. It will also automatically disable the code and notify the guest when the pre-defined date is hit.
